## Reflection

1. What went well on this project?

    Quite a couple of things, I was able to collaborate with other student to work at solving the problems, I learned that while Java is not my favorite language, I do quite enjoy strictly typed languages as it made me think differently about how I should write the code.

2. What problems did you have on this project?

    I struggled more with thinking through the Initials program more than I did with the Numbers program.

Your submission of this project is your affirmation that all the work you have submitted is your own, except as allowed in the assignment.
