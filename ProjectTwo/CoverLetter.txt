Discussion Questions:

1. Overflow. Find out what happens when you try to add to numbers that exceeds Integer.MAX_INT,
   test two billion plus two billion. What result did you get?
   
   Give me a number
   2000000000
   Give me another number
   2000000000
   2000000000 + 2000000000 = -294967296

2. Explain inexact results on integer division such as
    2 / 5 = 0  and  51 / 25 = 2
 
The reason these equate to the wrong value is that we are not settting the input variables to double

3. What syntax did you have the most trouble getting right?

I use Intellij IDE and tend not to run into issues with syntax.

4. What semantics did you have the most trouble understanding?

I struggled with getting the logic correct for running the "game loop" and fetching multiple 
user inputs.
