___ Project 3: Letter Distribution ___

Goal: Create a program that reads in a text file, keeps track of the
occurrences of the letters A-Z (case insensitive), and displays it at the
end in a bar graph where the Y axis is the Percentage Distribution and the
X axis are the Letters.

What tools do we have?

- Arrays and ArrayLists
- Scanner

What tools could we also use?

- Hashmap


```java

// How do we read in a file?
File fileToRead = new File($filepath);
Scanner fileScanner = new Scanner(fileToRead);

// How do we iterate through the file?
while(fileScanner.hasNext())
{
    // Implementation not show...
}

```

How do we calculate percentage?

(part / whole) * 100;

### PSEUDOCODE ###

Application Data

Occurrences of letter A-Z in each line of a text file

The best way to track this is using a Key:Value store, which can be done using a HashMap
in Java

create it as -> Map<Character, Integer> letterFrequency = new HashMap<Character, Integer>(26);

Similar to a 'dict' in Python

letter_frequency = {
    'a': 0,
    'b': 0,
    'c': 0,
    ...
}

Some useful methods belonging to the Map class
- .values()
- .keySet()
- .put()
