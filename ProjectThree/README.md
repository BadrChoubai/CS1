# Project Three Specification


The goal of this project is to visualize the distribution of letters provided
to us in sentences from four test files (provided along with Specifications
file).

We can visualize this using the BarChart class created for us in the
*BarChart.java* file, run it a few times to see how it works (but, do not
change the code).
