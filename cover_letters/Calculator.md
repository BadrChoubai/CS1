## Discussion Questions

1. Overflow - Find out what happens when you try to add two numbers whose sum exceeds the maximum integer value. Test two billion plus two billion. What result did you get? Explain why overflow happens on a computer.

2. Explain inexact results on integer division such as:

        2 / 5 = 0 and 51 / 25 = 2

3. What syntax (Java grammar rules) did you have the most trouble getting right?

4. What semantics (meaning of the code) did you have the most trouble understanding?

### Answers

1. When attempting to add two billion plus two billion I encountered a Java compiler error.

2. This happen because the division solver returns an int and not a floating point number.

3. System.out.printf("%d %% %d = %s \n", operandOne, operandTwo, operandOne % operandTwo);

4. The method classifications: public, protected, private.
