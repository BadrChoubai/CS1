## Overview

This program implements a simple, interactive calculator.

### Major Topics

- Writing a program from scratch
- Multiple Methods
- testing

### Discussion Questions (Answers in cover letter)

1. Overflow - Find out what happens when you try to add two numbers whose sum exceeds the maximum integer value. Test two billion plus two billion. What result did you get? Explain why overflow happens on a computer.

2. Explain inexact results on integer division such as:

        2 / 5 = 0 and 51 / 25 = 2

3. What syntax (Java grammar rules) did you have the most trouble getting right?

4. What semantics (meaning of the code) did you have the most trouble understanding?

### Deliverables

- Cover letter with discussion question
- Source code (1 .java class)
- text file with cut-and-paste copy of testing session #5

### Documentation
